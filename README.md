## The BurnJaro Philosophy: Beyond Diets

BurnJaro was born out of Dr. Alicia Jaro’s personal struggle with obesity and her quest to find a lasting solution. Disillusioned with restrictive diets and yo-yo weight fluctuations, she researched behavioral science, nutrition, and exercise physiology, ultimately creating BurnJaro—a method emphasizing:

1. **Personalization:** No two journeys are the same. Your plan adapts to your needs, preferences, and progress.
2. **Sustainability:** Focus on habits you can maintain, not quick fixes.
3. **Mind-Body Connection:** Recognize and manage emotional eating, stress, and self-sabotage.
4. **Community:** Harness the power of collective motivation, accountability, and celebration.
5. **Science-Driven:** Every strategy is rooted in peer-reviewed research and clinical evidence.
